            <h2>Beyond outrage</h2>
            <p>
            Rage baiting is a media tactic where stories are written or framed in a way that deliberately provokes anger or outrage. The goal is to trigger strong emotional reactions, which makes people more likely to click, share, and comment. This drives engagement and, in turn, increases ad revenue or subscription sales.  
            Rage bait reporting is exaggerated, sensational, or one-sided.  When a newsroom’s revenue depends on clicks and paywall conversions, the cheapest path to growth is fury—headlines that spike emotions, frames that assume the worst, and story selection that rewards conflict over clarity. 
            Continual repetition stokes the fire.   Rage-bait has costs. It erodes trust, polarises neighbours, and crowds out nuance.

             Crux news demonstrates all the attributes of rage baiting and it is costing our community. It pressures the council to govern for optics over outcomes, punishes transparency (every draft becomes a scandal), and fuels staff churn and policy whiplash. It confuses failure to perform with failure to communicate—and sometimes mistakes a messy process for a corrupt one.
