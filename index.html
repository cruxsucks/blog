            <h2>Beyond outrage</h2>
            <p>Rage-baiting is a media tactic that frames stories to provoke anger and outrage. The aim is to trigger strong emotions that drive clicks, shares, and comments—fueling engagement, subscriptions, and ad revenue. It often relies on exaggeration, sensational framing, or one-sided narratives. When a newsroom’s income depends on paywalls and conversions, the cheapest path to growth is fury: headlines that spike emotions, frames that assume the worst, and story selection that rewards conflict over clarity. Repetition then stokes the fire. The costs are real: it erodes trust, polarises neighbours, and crowds out nuance.</p>
            <p>Crux often exhibits these patterns, and it’s costing our community. It pressures council to govern for optics over outcomes, punishes transparency (every draft becomes a scandal), confuses performance failures with communication failures—and sometimes mistakes a messy process for a corrupt one.</p>
            <p>If you find yourself feeling angry or outraged, pause and think critically: Why am I angry? What evidence supports the claim? Is there another side? Is there a more balanced way to view this? ChatGPT can help: paste a Crux article and ask it to identify sensational framing, missing context, and the strongest evidence on both sides.</p>
