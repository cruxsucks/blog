# Crux News: Journalism or Opinion?

When Peter Newport launched Crux in 2018, he promised fearless investigative journalism for the Queenstown Lakes District. Six years on, his track record tells another story — one of sensational headlines, blurred boundaries between fact and opinion, and repeated brushes with the New Zealand Media Council.

## Complaints tell the story

Crux has faced multiple Media Council complaints, with muliple breach of journalistic principals upheld:

- **QLDC v Crux (2020)** — Case 2891
- Principle 1 (accuracy, fairness and balance) **complaint upheld**
- Principle 4 (comment and fact) **complaint upheld**
- The Media Council wrote:
- *'Newport himself says Crux is "consistently opinionated in favour of the community".'*
- *'This article presents as a news story, yet opinion intrudes on multiple occasions. Readers will be perplexed as to whether this article is a work of fact or comment; it reads as a collision of both without clear labelling.'*

- **Jimmy Carling v Crux (2020)** — Case 2895
The Media Council wrote:
- '*Having said that, the article overall is a mix of comment and fact that blurs the line between the two... As noted in our previous ruling regarding Crux, if it fails to distinguish between the two it will continue to be in jeopardy whenever its articles are referred to the Council.*'
- '*The complaint is far from frivolous and should give Crux pause for thought in how it conducts itself online and distinguishes between fact and comment. The Council considered upholding the complaint due to the amount of opinion liberally sprinkled through a story that was presented as news. If Crux wants to keep writing stories like these using first-person narrative and the writer's opinions, they would do better to clearly identify them to readers as opinion, as per Principle 4. We strongly suggest Crux take greater care in the future.*'
- '*Put together, the article, Facebook exchange and phone call do not reflect well on Crux.*'

- **Queenstown Airport Corporation v Crux (2020)** — Case 2940
- Principle 1 (accuracy, fairness and balance)  **3 complaints upheld**
- Principle 4 (comment and fact)  **2 complaints upheld**
- Principle 6 (headlines and captions) **2 complaints upheld** 
- The Media Council wrote: '*Crux ... needs to apply the standards of ethical journalism.*'


- **Jendi Paterson v Crux (2021)** — Case 3012
- While the complaint was not upheld, the Media Council was critical of Crux:
- '*As we have said in some of those past rulings... Crux’s reporting has repeatedly crossed the line, especially in its failure to separate fact and comment.*'
- '*Most concerning is Crux’s inaccurate reporting... It seems Crux made assumptions, which is another example of the sometimes sloppy reporting by Crux.*'

- **Queenstown Lakes District Council v Crux Publishing** — Case 3338
- '*A clear distinction should be drawn between factual information and comment or opinion. An article that is essentially comment or opinion should be clearly presented as such.*'

- **Andrew Tipene v Crux (2022)** — Case 3356
- Principle 1 (accuracy, fairness and balance) **complaint upheld**
- Principle 6 (headlines and captions) **complaint upheld**
- The Media Council again wrote: *as we have previously noted... Crux must ensure that it meets journalistic standards.*

The pattern is clear: when Newport's work is tested against standards of factual accuracy, complaints are upheld. When his articles are shielded as "opinion," they survive. The Media Council has repeatedly noted ethical journalistic standards in responce to Crux reporting. 

## Trying to silence rivals

In 2025, Newport turned complainant, filing against the Otago Daily Times. He claimed ODT had:

- Published false council statements without verification, undermining Crux's reporting.
- Copied a Crux story without attribution.

It was, in effect, an attempt to shut down a rival outlet for challenging his framing. The Media Council dismissed the complaint outright: no plagiarism, no inaccuracy, no grounds to proceed. The case exposed Newport's willingness to use the complaints process to protect his own sensationalism — and how little evidence he had to back it up.

## Controversy for profit

In late 2024, Newport moved Crux behind a paywall. His income now depends on subscriptions and clicks. Every provocative headline that draws outrage directly translates into revenue.

This is not a small shift. Crux already had a history of complaints about misleading headlines. Now Crux is financially rewarded for stoking division. Controversy is the business model.

## Readers, beware

These rage bait business models are incentiviesed to tracks what you read click, share, and linger on. Algrithms reward sensationalism, so more of it is produced. The result is a cycle where the most provocative stories are promoted and replicated. Balanced reporting loses ground to outrage-driven content.  Readers should understand: engagement is the product. Each click fuels an algorithmic loop that encourages more sensationalism, reinforcing Crux's strategy of trading on controversy.  

Self reflect, if you angry or outraged when you read Crux, then please learn more about rage baiting and how it is used to manipulate you. 

## The verdict

Crux continues to style itself a investigative journalism. But investigative reporting requires rigorous fact-checking, fairness, and a clear distinction between fact and opinion. Crux's record shows repeated failures on those measures, rescued only when his work is categorised as opinion. His own complaint against ODT collapsed under scrutiny. And with a paywall in place, his incentive is to produce headlines that spark outrage, not balance.
