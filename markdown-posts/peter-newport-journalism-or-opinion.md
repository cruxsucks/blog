# Crux News: Journalism or Opinion?

When Peter Newport launched Crux in 2018, he promised fearless investigative journalism for the Queenstown Lakes District. Six years on, his track record tells another story — one of sensational headlines, blurred boundaries between fact and opinion, and repeated brushes with the New Zealand Media Council.

## Complaints tell the story

Crux has faced multiple Media Council complaints, several of them upheld:

- **Andrew Tipene v Crux (2022)** — Upheld for inaccuracy and misleading headlines.
- **Queenstown Airport Corp v Crux (2020)** — Upheld for presenting opinion as fact.
- **QLDC v Crux (2022)** — Not upheld, but only because the piece was treated as "opinion/analysis."
- **Other QLDC complaints (2020)** — Mixed outcomes, with fairness again questioned.

The pattern is clear: when Newport's work is tested against standards of factual accuracy, complaints are upheld. When his articles are shielded as "opinion," they survive.

## Trying to silence rivals

In 2025, Newport turned complainant, filing against the Otago Daily Times. He claimed ODT had:

- Published false council statements without verification, undermining Crux's reporting.
- Copied a Crux story without attribution.

It was, in effect, an attempt to shut down a rival outlet for challenging his framing. The Media Council dismissed the complaint outright: no plagiarism, no inaccuracy, no grounds to proceed. The case exposed Newport's willingness to use the complaints process to protect his own sensationalism — and how little evidence he had to back it up.

## Controversy for profit

In late 2024, Newport moved Crux behind a paywall. His income now depends on subscriptions and clicks. Every provocative headline that draws outrage directly translates into revenue.

This is not a small shift. Crux already had a history of complaints about misleading headlines. Now Crux is financially rewarded for stoking division. Controversy has become his business model.

## Readers, beware

These rage bait business models are incentiviesed to tracks what you read click, share, and linger on. Algrithms reward sensationalism, so more of it is produced. The result is a cycle where the most provocative stories are promoted and replicated. Balanced reporting loses ground to outrage-driven content.  Readers should understand: engagement is the product. Each click fuels an algorithmic loop that encourages more sensationalism, reinforcing Crux's strategy of trading on controversy.  

Self reflect, if you angry or outraged when you read Crux, then please learn more about rage baiting and how it is used to manipulate you. 

## The verdict

Peter Newport continues to style himself as an investigative journalist. But investigative reporting requires rigorous fact-checking, fairness, and a clear distinction between fact and opinion. Newport's record shows repeated failures on those measures, rescued only when his work is categorised as opinion. His own complaint against ODT collapsed under scrutiny. And with a paywall in place, his incentive is to produce headlines that spark outrage, not balance.

The reality is simple: Newport is not an investigative journalist. He is an opinion writer, financially dependent on controversy. Readers should treat Crux accordingly — as commentary wrapped in sensational packaging, not the rigorous journalism it claims to be.

## Newport's Media Council Record

- **2022** – Tipene v Crux → Upheld (inaccuracy, misleading headline)
- **2020** – QAC v Crux → Upheld (opinion as fact)
- **2022** – QLDC v Crux → Not upheld (treated as opinion)
- **2020** – QLDC v Crux → Mixed outcome
- **2025** – Newport v ODT → Rejected outright — attempt to silence a rival failed

**Pattern**: loses when tested for accuracy, survives under opinion, fails when attacking others.
